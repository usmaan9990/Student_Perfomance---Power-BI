# Student_Perfomance-PowerBI

This project explores student achievement in secondary education at two Portuguese schools. The dataset includes student grades, demographic, social, and school-related features, collected via school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided, representing performance in Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por).

This page provides an overview of student performance, offering the following insights:

1.Total Number of Students: Displays the total count of students included in this dataset.

2.Average Age: Shows the average age of the students.

3.Average G1 and G2 Marks: Presents the average grades for the first and second periods.

3.Slicer: Allows users to select a subject (Mathematics or Portuguese).

4.Gender Distribution Pie Chart: Illustrates the distribution of students by gender.

5.School Distribution Pie Chart: Depicts the distribution of students across the two schools.

6.G3 (Final Grade) Distribution Histogram: Shows the distribution of final grades (G3) among the students.

This page includes detailed insights into student performance based on personal information:

1.Slicer: A step-by-step slicer allowing selection by school, subject, and gender.

2.Age Histogram: Displays the age distribution of students.

3.Final Grades (G3) Histogram: Shows the distribution of final grades (G3) among the students.

4.Family Relationship Status Donut Chart: Illustrates the status of students' family relationships.

5.Reason for Choosing School Treemap: Displays reasons why students chose a particular school.

6.Health Status Treemap: Shows the health status of students.

7.Decomposition Tree: Analyzes students' address types, breaking down further into the education levels of fathers and mothers.

This page provides an in-depth analysis of student performance:

1.Scatter Plot: Examines the relationship between the G3 score and the number of absence days.

2.Scatter Plot: Analyzes the relationship between the G3 score and the G1 & G2 scores.

3.Final Grades (G3) Histogram: Shows the distribution of final grades (G3) among the students.

4.Travel Time Category Donut Chart: Displays the travel time categories for students.

5.Stacked Column Chart: Shows the count of students' past failures and whether those students receive family support.

6.Decomposition Tree: First examines whether students attend paid classes, then whether they have free time, and finally their study time.
